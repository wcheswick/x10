<P> <STRONG>Note</STRONG>:  This section applies to 60 Hz North American wiring.  Relevance of
this to European wiring is not known.
<P> Each ONE bit in a legitimate X10 transmission is a 1 millisecond (mS) pulse 
code modulated burst of 120KHz on the AC line, and each ZERO is the absence 
of that burst.  The exact length of the burst may not be too critical in 
most applications.  The burst is sent three times for each bit, once at 
each AC zero-crossing (accounting for zero-crossing in 3-phase).  That 
means once each 2.778 mS.  The next bit is sent on the following zero-
crossing.  This is done to get the quietest time on the AC line for the 
receiver, whatever phase of the AC it's on.  The zero crossing gives the 
best signal-to-noise ratio for data transmission because everything should 
be shut down then (i.e. the voltage is low).

In addition, each bit is sent both true and complemented, and each code 
sequence is sent twice.  That's a lot of bit redundancy, and just barely 
enough to make it past the noise on the line, depending on actual 
conditions. 
<P> A single normal command takes eleven cycles of the AC line to finish.  All 
legal commands must first start with the header 1110, a unique code as 
described below.  The header bits take two cycles at one bit per half 
cycle.  The next four cycles are the four-bit House Code, but it takes 
eight bits total because each bit is sent true then complemented.  This is 
similar to biphase encoding, as the bit value changes state half-way 
through the transmission, and improves transmission reliability.  The last 
five AC cycles are the Unit / Function Code, a five bit code that takes ten 
bits (again, true then complemented).  For any codes except the DIM, BRIGHT 
and the data following the EXTENDED DATA function, there's a mandatory 
three cycle pause before sending another command  DIM and BRIGHT don't 
necessarily need a pause, and the data after the EXTENDED DATA command 
absolutely MUST follow immediately until all bytes have been sent.  The 
EXTENDED DATA code is handy, as any number of eight-bit bytes may follow. 
The data bytes must follow the true/complement rule, so will take eight 
cycles per byte, with no pause between bytes until complete. The only legal 
sequence that doesn't conform to the true/complement rule are the start 
bits 1110 that lead the whole thing off, likely because the modules need 
some way to tell when it's OK to start listening again. 
<P> A full transmission containing everything looks like this (see the end of
this section for the actual command codes):
<P> <PRE>
   1 1 1 0  H8 /H8 H4 /H4 H2 /H2 H1 /H1  D8 /D8 D4 /D4 D2 /D2 D1 /D1 F /F
   (start)         (House code)                 (Unit/Function code)

</PRE>
So, to turn on Unit 12 of House code A, send the following:
<P> <PRE>
   1 1 1 0   0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1   1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1  (House A, Unit 12)

</PRE>
then wait at least three full AC cycles and send it again, then wait three
and send:
<P> <PRE>
   1 1 1 0   0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1   0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0  (House A, Function ON)

</PRE>
again wait three cycles and send it the last time.  Total transmission
would have been 264 discrete bits (don't forget the 3-phase) and would take
53 cycles of the AC line, or about .883 seconds.
<P> It's perfectly allowable to stack the Unit or Function codes together, so
sending Unit 2  Unit 3  Unit 12  ON (separated by 3 cycles minimum) will
turn on all 3 units.  Stacking ON and OFF codes is annoying and flashes the
lights quickly (roughly 4 Hz).

</PRE>
<STRONG>Note 1</STRONG>:  Hail Request is transmitted to see if there are any other X10
         compatible transmitters within listening range.
<P> <STRONG>Note 2</STRONG>:  In a Pre-Set Dim function, the D1 bit represents the MSB of the
         level and the 4 House code bits represent the 4 least significant
         bits.  No known X10 device responds to the Pre-Set Dim function.
<P> <STRONG>Note 3</STRONG>:  The Extended Data code is followed by eight-bit bytes which can
         be any data you might want to send (like temperature).  There
         must be no delay between the Extended Data code and the actual
         data bytes, and no delay between data bytes.
<P> <STRONG>Note 4</STRONG>:  The X10 RF to AC Gateway model RR501 is a two-way module.  If the
         RR501 is addressed by transmitting its House Code and Unit Code and
         then the STATUS REQUEST is transmitted, the RR501 will respond by
         transmitting Status ON if it's turned on, or Status OFF if it's off.
